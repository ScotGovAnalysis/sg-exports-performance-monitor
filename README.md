# sg-exports-performance-monitor
Code behind the Scottish Government's application for display of exports data titled "Exports Performance Monitor".  The highlight of the code is the original solution to generate downloadable reports, where R markdown document is used to render the report on the app as well as for rendering the document in the form of PDF and Word document. One file to rule them all.
